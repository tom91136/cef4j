/**
 * Implement this interface to handle events related to CefFrame life span. The order of callbacks is: (1) During
 * initial CefBrowserHost creation and navigation of the main frame: - CefFrameHandler::OnFrameCreated => The initial
 * main frame object has been created. Any commands will be queued until the frame is attached. -
 * CefFrameHandler::OnMainFrameChanged => The initial main frame object has been assigned to the browser. -
 * CefLifeSpanHandler::OnAfterCreated => The browser is now valid and can be used. - CefFrameHandler::OnFrameAttached =>
 * The initial main frame object is now connected to its peer in the renderer process. Commands can be routed. (2)
 * During further CefBrowserHost navigation/loading of the main frame and/or sub-frames: -
 * CefFrameHandler::OnFrameCreated => A new main frame or sub-frame object has been created. Any commands will be queued
 * until the frame is attached. - CefFrameHandler::OnFrameAttached => A new main frame or sub-frame object is now
 * connected to its peer in the renderer process. Commands can be routed. - CefFrameHandler::OnFrameDetached => An
 * existing main frame or sub-frame object has lost its connection to the renderer process. If multiple objects are
 * detached at the same time then notifications will be sent for any sub-frame objects before the main frame object.
 * Commands can no longer be routed and will be discarded. - CefFremeHadler::OnFrameDestroyed => An existing main frame
 * or sub-frame object has been destroyed. - CefFrameHandler::OnMainFrameChanged => A new main frame object has been
 * assigned to the browser. This will only occur with cross-origin navigation or re-navigation after renderer process
 * termination (due to crashes, etc). (3) During final CefBrowserHost destruction of the main frame: -
 * CefFrameHandler::OnFrameDetached => Any sub-frame objects have lost their connection to the renderer process.
 * Commands can no longer be routed and will be discarded. - CefFreameHandler::OnFrameDestroyed => Any sub-frame objects
 * have been destroyed. - CefLifeSpanHandler::OnBeforeClose => The browser has been destroyed. -
 * CefFrameHandler::OnFrameDetached => The main frame object have lost its connection to the renderer process.
 * Notifications will be sent for any sub-frame objects before the main frame object. Commands can no longer be routed
 * and will be discarded. - CefFreameHandler::OnFrameDestroyed => The main frame object has been destroyed. -
 * CefFrameHandler::OnMainFrameChanged => The final main frame object has been removed from the browser. Special
 * handling applies for cross-origin loading on creation/navigation of sub-frames, and cross-origin loading on creation
 * of new popup browsers. A temporary frame will first be created in the parent frame's renderer process. This temporary
 * frame will never attach and will be discarded after the real cross-origin frame is created in the new/target renderer
 * process. The client will receive creation callbacks for the temporary frame, followed by cross-origin navigation
 * callbacks (2) for the transition from the temporary frame to the real frame. The temporary frame will not receive or
 * execute commands during this transitional period (any sent commands will be discarded). When the main frame navigates
 * to a different origin the OnMainFrameChanged callback (2) will be executed with the old and new main frame objects.
 * Callbacks will not be executed for placeholders that may be created during pre-commit navigation for sub-frames that
 * do not yet exist in the renderer process. Placeholders will have CefFrame::GetIdentifier() == -4. The methods of this
 * class will be called on the UI thread unless otherwise indicated.
